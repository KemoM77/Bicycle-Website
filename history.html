        <h1>Hestory of bicycles</h1>
       <p id="p1">Before the creation of the today’s modern bicycle, there were several examples of simpler bicycle transport devices.
         It all started in 16th century with the discovery of 1493 Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches, which included simple designs for bicycle.
          Some historians claim that either his student Gian Giacomo Caprotti made this drawing or that is altogether fake. 
          That design was never produced into working model and in following four hundred years horses remained only
           affordable means of transport on public road. </p>

       <p id="p2"> The German Baron Karl von Drais invented precursor to the modern bicycle during early 19th century. 
        This velocipede named “Laufmaschine” consisted of two wheels that were held together with one central bar. 
        Driver of that vehicle had to walk and run to gather the needed speed and then raise his legs and continue to cruise until his
         momentum faded. Design of Von Drais was improved in England with the commercially successful “Dandy Horse”.</p>

       <p id="p3"> That design remained in use for almost 40 years until two French carriage makers came to idea that would revolutionize the bicycle world.
         Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallemen saw how “Dandy Horse” is used and they devised the plan to attach the pedals to the front wheel,
          and install the driving seat on the support beam.</p>

        <p id="p4">  In 1864, they made their first model that proved to be very efficient and easy to produce. Four years later, 
        they gathered the funds for mass production and begun improving their initial design in to what will become known as “Boneshaker”. 
        Bicycle frame were made from Iron instead of wood, and soon they started including rubber tires and ball bearings. 
        One of the most popular.</p>
