        <h1 id="welcoming"> Welcome to Bicycle Galaxy !</h1>
         <p id="p1"><strong>A bicycle</strong>, also called a bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered,
          pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame,
            one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.<br></p>

          <p id="p2"> Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe,
            and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a
            given time. These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked 
            by the number of individual models produced. They are the principal means 
            of transportation in many regions.<br></p>
            <p id="p3">The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of 
            culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that 
            eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially 
            invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic 
            tires, chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels.<br></p>
